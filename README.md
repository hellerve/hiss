**DISCLAIMER:** This was a preproject for my programming language. The real deal can be found [here](github.com/zepto-lang/zepto).

A custom, minimal Lisp. The name is both derived from the lisping sound and stands for "Highly Interesting Scribbling Subject".

It is not anything yet. But it should compile and run fine.

<hr/>

It uses a slightly modified version of [orangeduck's excellent mpc](https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc) internally for parsing and editline for the REPL mode. Everything else is broken, because I had to write it.
